# Thesis Repo
For now while I am working on this Thesis this repo is mainly intended for myself.

Data and models are not hosted in this repository.

## MODEL REPOSITORY
Will start trying to name models by some string identifier because it is getting rough to keep track of everything when they're all named descriptively on the model characteristics. 

Instead. I'll be using GitHub Issues and a [release name generator](https://codesandbox.io/s/y0vvq1q7x9).
